# Course Structure Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook structure and learning pathways.

## The Four-Module Architecture

The course is organized around four core modules that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of humanoid robotics:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- **Focus**: Communication architecture for robotic systems
- **Key Concepts**: Nodes, topics, services, actions
- **Learning Outcome**: Understanding how software components communicate reliably in real time
- **Applications**: Foundation for all subsequent modules

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- **Focus**: Simulation for safe iteration and testing
- **Key Concepts**: Physics simulation, sensor simulation, digital twin methodology
- **Learning Outcome**: Creating virtual environments for robot development
- **Applications**: Testing and validation before real-world deployment

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- **Focus**: Advanced perception, navigation, and AI integration
- **Key Concepts**: VSLAM, Nav2, Isaac Sim/ROS, sim-to-real transition
- **Learning Outcome**: Building intelligent perception and navigation systems
- **Applications**: Real-world robot autonomy

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) & Conversational Robotics
- **Focus**: Natural language interaction and multimodal systems
- **Key Concepts**: Voice-to-action, cognitive planning, multimodal interaction
- **Learning Outcome**: Building conversational robots that respond to natural language
- **Applications**: Human-robot interaction and assistive robotics

## Learning Pathways

### Path 1: Sequential Learning (Recommended for Beginners)
1. Complete each module in order (1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
2. Follow the weekly path for structured progression
3. Complete all labs before moving to the next module
4. Build toward the capstone project incrementally

### Path 2: Topic-Based Learning (Recommended for Experienced Developers)
1. Assess your current knowledge in each module area
2. Focus on modules that address knowledge gaps
3. Use the course as a reference while working on projects
4. Complete the capstone project to integrate knowledge

### Path 3: Capstone-First Approach (Recommended for Advanced Learners)
1. Review the [Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid](/docs/capstone/index) requirements
2. Identify knowledge gaps needed to complete the capstone
3. Study relevant modules to fill those gaps
4. Iterate between capstone work and module study

## Integration Points

The modules are designed to work together through key integration points:

- **Module 1 → Module 2**: ROS 2 concepts applied to simulation communication
- **Module 2 → Module 3**: Simulated sensors feed into perception systems
- **Module 3 → Module 4**: AI outputs translated to natural language commands
- **All → Capstone**: All concepts integrated in the final project

## Navigation Guide

### For New Learners
1. Start with the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) guide
2. Work through modules sequentially
3. Complete all labs and exercises
4. Build toward the capstone project

### For Reference Users
1. Use the sidebar to jump directly to specific topics
2. Check the [Glossary](/docs/glossary/index) for terminology
3. Review the [Labs](/docs/labs/index) for practical examples
4. Refer to the [Hardware & Lab Setup](/docs/hardware-lab/index) for technical requirements

## Assessment and Validation

Each module includes:
- Conceptual understanding exercises
- Practical implementation labs
- Troubleshooting guides
- Integration checkpoints

The [Capstone Project](/docs/capstone/index) synthesizes all knowledge with:
- Complete pipeline implementation
- Deliverables checklist
- Integration guidance
