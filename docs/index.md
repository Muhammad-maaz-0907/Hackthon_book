# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Living Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This living textbook bridges the gap between AI models and embodied intelligence, covering the essential technologies needed to build intelligent robotic systems.

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into four core modules that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of humanoid robotics:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn how software components communicate reliably in real time using ROS 2
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Master simulation as the "digital twin" that enables safe iteration
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Explore advanced perception, synthetic data, VSLAM, and navigation
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) & Conversational Robotics** - Connect LLMs, speech, vision to robot actions

## Learning Path

We've designed this textbook with both structured learners and reference users in mind. You can follow the weekly path (Weeks 1-13) for guided progression or jump directly to specific topics using the module-based organization.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:
- Design and implement ROS 2 systems for robotic applications
- Create and use digital twins for safe robot development and testing
- Apply AI techniques for perception, navigation, and control
- Build conversational robotics systems that respond to natural language commands
- Complete an end-to-end "Autonomous Humanoid" capstone project
