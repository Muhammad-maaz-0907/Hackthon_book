# Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have the following knowledge and tools:

## Technical Background

- **Python Programming**: Comfortable with intermediate Python concepts (classes, modules, packages, error handling)
- **Basic AI/ML Knowledge**: Understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts at a high level
- **Linux/Ubuntu Experience**: Familiarity with Ubuntu 22.04 (native or dual-boot) and command-line interface
- **Basic Linear Algebra**: Understanding of vectors, matrices, and transformations at a conceptual level

## Software Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (native installation or dual-boot recommended, WSL2 is acceptable but may have performance limitations)
- **Development Environment**: Basic CLI familiarity, Git, and package management tools
- **Web Browser**: Modern browser for accessing the documentation and web-based tools

## Recommended Preparation

Before diving into the modules, we recommend reviewing:

- Basic ROS 2 concepts if you're new to robotics middleware
- Fundamental concepts of coordinate systems and transformations
- Overview of simulation environments in robotics
- Basic understanding of sensors commonly used in robotics (cameras, LiDAR, IMU)

## Hardware Access

While not required to start the course, you should have access to one of the following approaches:

- **On-Premise Lab**: RTX workstation for simulation and development
- **Cloud-Based Access**: Cloud computing resources for simulation (see Hardware & Lab Setup section)
- **Simulation Only**: Focus on simulation-based learning without physical hardware

## Getting Help

If you find yourself missing any of these prerequisites, we recommend:

- Reviewing Python tutorials if you need to strengthen your programming skills
- Reading introductory robotics textbooks for fundamental concepts
- Practicing with basic Linux command line exercises

The course is designed to build from fundamentals, but having this background will help you progress more smoothly through the material.
