  Created comprehensive tasks.md for Module 4 Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems with 80 detailed tasks organized across 8 phases:

  1. Phase 1: Setup & Foundation (T001-T007) - Project structure and dependencies
  2. Phase 2: Foundational Components (T008-T019) - Core message definitions and node structures
  3. Phase 3: User Story 1 - VLA Pipeline Understanding (T020-T029) - Complete VLA concept
  4. Phase 4: User Story 2 - Voice-to-Action Integration (T030-T039) - Speech-to-action workflow
  5. Phase 5: User Story 3 - ROS 2 Actions Mapping (T040-T049) - LLM to ROS 2 integration
  6. Phase 6: User Story 4 - Multimodal Interaction (T050-T060) - Social interaction and capstone bridge
  7. Phase 7: Testing & Validation (T061-T069) - Comprehensive testing framework
  8. Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting (T070-T079) - Documentation and final validation

  All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths.

outcome: "Successfully completed tasks breakdown for Module 4 VLA system with 80 actionable tasks organized by user stories and implementation phases."
evaluation: "All required tasks created according to Spec-Kit standards with proper organization by user stories, dependencies mapped, and parallel execution opportunities identified."

# Module 4 VLA Tasks Generation

This record documents the task breakdown for Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book, focusing on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

## Summary of Work Completed

The task breakdown for the VLA system has been completed with 80 specific, actionable tasks organized across 8 implementation phases:

1. **Setup & Foundation**: Project structure and dependencies
2. **Foundational Components**: Core message definitions and node structures
3. **User Story 1**: VLA Pipeline Understanding (P1 priority)
4. **User Story 2**: Voice-to-Action Integration (P1 priority)
5. **User Story 3**: ROS 2 Actions Mapping (P2 priority)
6. **User Story 4**: Multimodal Interaction and Capstone Bridge (P2 priority)
7. **Testing & Validation**: Comprehensive testing framework
8. **Polish & Cross-Cutting**: Documentation and final validation

## Key Features

- All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths
- Tasks organized by user story priority to enable independent implementation
- Dependencies clearly mapped between components
- Parallel execution opportunities identified for efficient development
- Success criteria aligned with the original feature specification

## Next Steps

With the task breakdown complete, the next steps include:
1. Beginning implementation of the tasks in priority order
2. Tracking progress against the defined success criteria
3. Implementing the VLA system components according to the detailed specifications
4. Creating comprehensive documentation and testing as outlined in the tasks
