# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clarity for Target Audience
Content must be tailored to specific reader levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced); All concepts explained with appropriate depth for the target audience; Clear identification of assumed knowledge and prerequisites for each chapter.

### II. Consistency in Presentation
Maintain uniform voice, tone, and formatting across all chapters; Standardized chapter structure with consistent navigation elements; Consistent terminology and notation throughout the book; Uniform code example formatting and commenting style.

### III. Actionable Content with Practical Examples
Every concept must include practical examples and runnable code samples; Theory connected to real-world applications in humanoid robotics; Hands-on exercises that reinforce learning objectives; Code examples must be tested and verified to work correctly.

### IV. Progressive Learning Structure
Chapters and concepts must build upon each other in a logical sequence; Prerequisites clearly established before introducing new concepts; Spiral learning approach where complex topics are revisited with increasing depth; Learning pathways that accommodate different skill levels.

### V. Accessibility Through Clear Communication
Complex topics explained through clear explanations and visual aids; Alternative text provided for all diagrams and images; Code examples include detailed comments explaining functionality; Multiple learning modalities accommodated (text, visual, practical).

### VI. Technical Excellence
Platform: Docusaurus 3.x with GitHub Pages deployment; All code examples tested and validated before inclusion; Zero broken links or missing images in published content; Site builds without errors or warnings; Automated CI/CD pipeline maintained for consistent deployments.

## Content Standards
Minimum chapter length: 1,500 words; Maximum chapter length: 4,000 words for readability; Balanced code-to-text ratio with explanations; External links must be current and from reputable sources; Quarterly reviews for content accuracy and currency.

## Development Workflow
Chapter structure: Introduction → Core concepts → Examples → Summary → Exercises; All code must be tested and include comprehensive comments; Writing style uses active voice with conversational yet professional tone; Readability maintained with Flesch Reading Ease score 60+; Navigation provides clear chapter hierarchy and cross-references.

## Governance
This constitution governs all content creation and technical decisions for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project; All contributions must comply with these principles; Amendments require documentation of changes and team approval; Regular compliance reviews ensure adherence to standards; Version control follows Git with meaningful commit messages.
